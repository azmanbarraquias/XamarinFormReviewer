        The Xamarin.Forms MasterDetailPage is a page that manages two related pages of information
        – a master page that presents items, and a detail page that presents details about items on the master page.
        This article explains how to use a MasterDetailPage and navigate between its pages of information.
        
        The location of the list of items is identical on each platform, and selecting one of the items will navigate
        to the corresponding detail page. In addition, the master page also features a navigation bar that contains
        a button that can be used to navigate to the active detail page:
        
        > On iOS, the navigation bar is present at the top of the page and has a button that navigates to the detail page.
        In addition, the active detail page can be navigated to by swiping the master page to the left.
        > On Android, the navigation bar is present at the top of the page and displays a title, an icon,
        and a button that navigates to the detail page. The icon is defined in the [Activity] attribute that
        decorates the MainActivity class in the Android platform-specific project. In addition, the active detail
        page can be navigated to by swiping the master page to the left, by tapping the detail page at the far right
        of the screen, and by tapping the Back button at the bottom of the screen.
        > On the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), the navigation bar is present at the top of the page and has
        a button that navigates to the detail page.
