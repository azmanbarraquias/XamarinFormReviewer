    <!--
        ItemSelected is a state while ItemTapped is a motion event. All views can be tapped and if
        I remember correctly all views can be selected (or at least activated there is a subtle difference),
        the two don't have to go together but they usually do.
        
        For example you'd have an item's selected state toggled each time a tapped motion event has occurred.
        Once again just to make it more clear you can associate the changes of the selected state to whatever
        you need whether it's a motion event like tapping or long pressing or double tapping and so on
        or to some other event or logic.
