        The d: - XAML namespace is intended for designer support,
        specifically designer support in the XAML design surfaces of
        Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft Expression Blend.
        The d: XAML namespace enables designer attributes on XAML elements.
        These designer attributes only affect the design aspects of how XAML behaves.
        The designer attributes are ignored when the same XAML is loaded by the XAML
        parser in the Silverlight run-time, and the application runs. Generally,
        the designer attributes are valid on any XAML element,
        but in practice there are only certain scenarios
        where applying a designer attribute yourself is appropriate.
        
        mc - Specifies which XML namespace prefixes encountered in a markup file
        may be ignored by a XAML processor. The mc:Ignorable attribute supports
        markup compatibility both for custom namespace mapping and for XAML versioning.
        
        x:Class
        - This attribute belong to the microsoft namespace.
        look at the value assign thisCodeName.projectName - name of
        code behind
        - Configures XAML markup compilation to join partial classes between markup
        and code-behind. The code partial class is defined in a separate code file in a Common Language
        Specification (CLS) language, whereas the markup partial class
        is typically created by code generation during XAML compilation.
