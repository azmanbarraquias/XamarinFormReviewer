                Xamarin.Forms DatePicker
                
                A Xamarin.Forms view that allows the user to select a date.
                
                The Xamarin.Forms DatePicker invokes the platform's date-picker control and allows the user to select a date. DatePicker defines eight properties:
                
                > MinimumDate of type DateTime, which defaults to the first day of the year 1900.
                > MaximumDate of type DateTime, which defaults to the last day of the year 2100.
                > Date of type DateTime, the selected date, which defaults to the value DateTime.Today.
                > Format of type string, a standard or custom .NET formatting string, which defaults to "D", the long date pattern.
                > TextColor of type Color, the color used to display the selected date, which defaults to Color.Default.
                > FontAttributes of type FontAttributes, which defaults to FontAtributes.None.
                > FontFamily of type string, which defaults to null.
                > FontSize of type double, which defaults to -1.0.
                > CharacterSpacing, of type double, is the spacing between characters of the DatePicker text.
                > The DatePicker fires a DateSelected event when the user selects a date.
                
                Warning:
                When setting MinimumDate and MaximumDate, make sure that MinimumDate is always less than or
                equal to MaximumDate. Otherwise, DatePicker will raise an exception.
                
                Internally, the DatePicker ensures that Date is between MinimumDate and MaximumDate, inclusive.
                If MinimumDate or MaximumDate is set so that Date is not between them,
                DatePicker will adjust the value of Date.
                
                By default Date picker will get the date today, time not.

                Xamarin.Forms TimePicker
                
                A Xamarin.Forms view that allows the user to select a time.
                
                The Xamarin.Forms TimePicker invokes the platform's time-picker control and allows the user to select a time.
                TimePicker defines the following properties:
                
                > Time of type TimeSpan, the selected time, which defaults to a TimeSpan of 0. The TimeSpan type indicates
                a duration of time since midnight.
                > Format of type string, a standard or custom .NET formatting string, which defaults to "t",
                the short time pattern.
                > TextColor of type Color, the color used to display the selected time, which defaults to Color.Default.
                > FontAttributes of type FontAttributes, which defaults to FontAtributes.None.
                > FontFamily of type string, which defaults to null.
                > FontSize of type double, which defaults to -1.0.
                > CharacterSpacing, of type double, is the spacing between characters of the TimePicker text.
