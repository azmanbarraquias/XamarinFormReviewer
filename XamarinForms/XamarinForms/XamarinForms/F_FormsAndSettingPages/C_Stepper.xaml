        Xamarin.Forms Stepper
        
        Use a Stepper for selecting a numeric value from a range of values.
        
        The Xamarin.Forms Stepper consists of two buttons labeled with minus and plus signs.
        These buttons can be manipulated by the user to incrementally select a double value from a range of values.
        
        The Stepper defines four properties of type double:
        
        > Increment is the amount to change the selected value by, with a default value of 1.
        > Minimum is the minimum of the range, with a default value of 0.
        > Maximum is the maximum of the range, with a default value of 100.
        > Value is the stepper's value, which can range between Minimum and Maximum and has a default value of 0.
        
        All of these properties are backed by BindableProperty objects. The Value property has a default
        binding mode of BindingMode.TwoWay, which means that it's suitable as a binding source in an application
        that uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture.
        
        Warning
        
        Internally, the Stepper ensures that Minimum is less than Maximum.
        If Minimum or Maximum are ever set so that Minimum is not less than Maximum, an exception is raised.
        For more information on setting the Minimum and Maximum properties, see Precautions section.
