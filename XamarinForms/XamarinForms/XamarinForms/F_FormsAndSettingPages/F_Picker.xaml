        The Picker view is a control for selecting a text item from a list of data.
        
        The Xamarin.Forms Picker displays a short list of items, from which the user can select an item.
        Picker defines the following properties:
        
        Title of type string, which defaults to null.
        TitleColor of type Color, the color used to display the Title text.
        ItemsSource of type IList, the source list of items to display, which defaults to null.
        SelectedIndex of type int, the index of the selected item, which defaults to -1.
        SelectedItem of type object, the selected item, which defaults to null.
        TextColor of type Color, the color used to display the text, which defaults to Color.Default.
        FontAttributes of type FontAttributes, which defaults to FontAtributes.None.
        FontFamily of type string, which defaults to null.
        FontSize of type double, which defaults to -1.0.
        CharacterSpacing, of type double, is the spacing between characters of the item displayed by the Picker.
        All of the properties are backed by BindableProperty objects, which means that they can be styled,
        and the properties can be targets of data bindings. The SelectedIndex and SelectedItem properties have
        a default binding mode of BindingMode.TwoWay, which means that they can be targets of data bindings in
        an application that uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. For information
        about setting font properties, see Fonts.
