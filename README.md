# XamarinFormReviewer
This my Xamarin.Forms reviewer, where I learn how to build a native UIs for iOS, Android and Windows Phone from a single, shared C# codebase. It provides more than 40 cross-platform controls and layouts that are mapped to native controls at runtime, which means that your user interfaces are fully native.
